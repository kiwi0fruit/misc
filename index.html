<p>Greetings.</p>

<p>   I have spent more than two years creating a specific mathematical model. It’s origin is at the intersection of the following areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>  fundamental physics</li>
<li>  the theory of evolution</li>
<li>  metaphysics</li>
<li>  foundations of mathematics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not succeeded in creating the model. And at this point I have become exhausted. I ask your advice or any other help available regarding creating that model.</p>

<p>   The problem I’m trying to solve can be described as <strong>to create the simplest model possible in which the evolution of the laws of nature arises from the natural selection of structures.</strong> This approach implies indeterminism and postulates random and spontaneous nature of some events. It is also assumed that the universe had the beginning (the first moment of existence). This task is meant to provide the tychism doctrine by Charles Peirce with a mathematically accurate dynamic model.</p>

<p>   <strong>The general idea</strong> of the research program can be summarized as follows: to describe the beginning of the universe (and its development during first time) using the language of the theory of evolution. It’s assumed that the universe had the simple starting structure (the beginning). And the task is to describe mathematically accurate the starting structure and the process of it’s development in time. It also might be that there exist convincing arguments in favor the impossibility of creating that mathematical model.</p>

</h3>

<p>   To begin with, I will briefly remind the foundations of the theory of evolution. This theory is the cornerstone of the research program.</p>

<p>   Darwin’s theory of evolution is a theory that describes the process in which relatively simple structures transform into more complex structures under the influence of simple factors. The simple factors are the postulates of the natural selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>(<strong>p1</strong>) Population of individuals and the environment. The individuals themselves are part of the environment for other individuals.</li>
<li>(<strong>p2</strong>) Natural selection: the individuals that are more adapted to the environment survive more often.</li>
<li>(<strong>p3</strong>) Reproduction: each individual has a potential to reproduce itself. At least it has a potential to double the number of approximate copies of itself.</li>
<li>(<strong>p4</strong>) Heredity: properties of the individuals are inherited in reproduction.</li>
<li>(<strong>p5</strong>) Variation: when the individual reproduces itself, the reproduction does not occur precisely but with changes that are partly random/spontaneous (under a given set of postulates).</li>
</ul>

<p>As noted by Karl Popper the theory of evolution is a theory of gradual (!) changes that does not permit spontaneous appearance of monsters such as Boltzmann brain. This theory explains the entire path traversed by the life from the first unicellular organisms to Homo sapiens. And they differ much in complexity.</p>

<p>   The only one known to me explanation of how the complexity emerges from the simplicity is the theory of evolution. The complexity emerges by itself (!) and gradually when conditions (p1)-(p5) are met.</p>

</h3>

<p>   As already mentioned, the general idea of the research program can be summarized as follows: to describe the beginning of the universe (and its development during first time) using the language of the theory of evolution. It’s assumed that the universe had the simple starting structure (the beginning). And the task is to describe mathematically accurate the starting structure and the process of it’s development in time.</p>

<p>This problem is put under the following assumptions:</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> The universe is entirely knowable by humans. The birth of the universe is also knowable. It is a kind of epistemological optimism. But at the same time, this knowledge and understanding may be unfalsifiable. The history is full of facts that can be assumed, but can not be verified (fortunately, not all the facts are such). The hypotheses about the past have this remarkable feature.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> The universe is finite at every moment of time. The present was preceded by a finite number of moments of time. The assumption of finiteness is akin to intuitionistic revision of mathematics. It’s a doubt that it’s correct to use the actual infinity. It is something like Ockham’s razor: do not assume infinity until the possibility of creating a theory of a finite universe had been investigated. Since we assume the absence of actual infinity, there remains a choice between an infinite number of moments of time in the past and finite number. A finite amount is less complex, so the priority is to investigate this possibility. As a result, the potential infinity (but not the actual infinity) remains only in the process of appearance of the future moments of time.</p>

<p><strong>(c​)</strong> There is a hypothesis that using the principles of the theory of evolution we can explain the origins of everything that precedes unicellular life. At least we can explain the origins of life (abiogenesis). But it’s not the most interesting thing. The most interesting thing is to explain the origin of inanimate matter. Given the fact that the theory of evolution explains the emergence of more complex structures from less complex structures, it can be expected that the earlier back in time we “return” the more simple structures we get. It could be more simple structures in terms of yet unknown statistical description. It is still the subject of discussion. So then the question arises: how simple the structure would be at the very beginning? “Nothing”, the empty set, “unity”, “one” or concepts of comparable simplicity come to mind. It also may be a more complex structure. A simple structure but not simpler than necessary. So the development of the universe from a very primitive state driven by evolution can be assumed. This implies spontaneous events of structure changes. And with these events the structure becomes more and more complex. The postulation of spontaneous events is what occurs in (p5) “variation”. There are also intuitions that postulate (p3) “reproduction” is also very important in this picture (This postulate describes at least a doubling of the existing structures). Spontaneous symmetry breaking may also be relevant.</p>

<p>   Paragraph (c​) is an intuitive guess. It echoes the ideas of Charles Peirce: his ideas of tychism and evolution of the laws of nature. In paragraph (c​) the laws of nature are like encapsulated in the evolving structures. Perhaps the laws can be derived from the structures with the help of statistical description. This, in turn, echoes the ideas of Ilya Prigogine and his attempts to get the arrow of time and irreversibility from the statistical description of ensembles in classical mechanics and his special version of quantum mechanics. There are also his ideas of synergetics and the birth of order from chaos.</p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong> Thus, the initial idea was to create a mathematical model that incorporates the following principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>A) factor of absolute spontaneity / chance / random,</li>
<li>B) factor of reproduction / doubling,</li>
<li>C) something akin to the law of conservation,</li>
<li>D) natural selection.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then to see if in this model would be stable structures (patterns?) that reproduce themselves and change over time. On the other hand modern theories that describe the fundamental workings of the universe, take into account the reality as it is now. That theories make the reconstruction of the past taking into account the reality as it is now. If we are under the assumptions (a), (b), (c​), then that theories must take into account the complexity that has arisen since the birth of the universe. We can only speculate about the age of the universe before the Big Bang. For example, according to the hypothesis of cosmological natural selection [<a href="#1">1</a>] our observable universe could have had a very large number of universes-ancestors. So the total age of the entire universe could be enormous. The research program I have described in this letter is an attempt to cheat and do not take into account the full history and complexity that may be enormous. It’s like a research “landing operation” in the past, an attempt to describe the universe from the very beginning of it, when it had a much simpler structure. Of course, this “landing” suffers from the lack of experimental evidence and verifiability. But the first goal is a proof of the concept: to create a model of primitive structures that survive (exist) and evolve over time. It is worth mentioning that the time should be real and fundamental in this evolutionary approach which is consistent with the ideas of Lee Smolin [<a href="#2">2</a>]. Perhaps in case of a successful first step, the ways of linking this approach with the observable universe may be found. If not then the methods of this approach (that are yet to be found) may be brought to other areas of scientific research. Which is also good.</p>

<p><strong>(e)</strong> The presumption of the existence of the objective reality (objectivity) plays an important role in attempts to construct a mathematical model that satisfies the insights mentioned above. Objective reality can be conceived independently of the perception of observers. In mathematical physics, the objective reality is determined by specifying equivalence classes in the set of reality descriptions in terms of different observers (different coordinate systems, etc.). The dependent on the observer part of the description is not included in the equivalence class. This procedure is called “gauging away” [<a href="#2">2</a>].</p>

<p><em><strong>The described research task is proposed to be accomplished by creating the mathematical model that is partly described in the section 2</strong></em>.</p>

</h3>

<p>   Some properties possessed by the mathematical model can already be assumed. The model is mathematical in the sense that it is required to build a unified language of envisioning and thinking about a specific process in time. This process is still far from clear and whole picture. Here I am referring to mathematics as a unified language for describing and modeling the reality and possible reality.</p>

<p>   The mathematical model is intended to describe the process of changing of a particular structure (consisting of interconnected atomic parts). Moreover, it should be the process of development and complication of the structure.</p>

<ul>
<li>The process starts from a very simple state of the structure. It may be something like “nothing”, the empty set, “unity” or “one”.</li>
<li>The rules or meta-rules of changing this simple state must also be initially defined.</li>
<li>Presumably, the rules at the same time give rise to the structure that consist of interconnected atomic parts, and produce the natural selection of relatively isolated parts of the structure.</li>
<li>The structure is discrete and finite. Steps of time that correspond to changes in the structure, are also discrete.</li>
</ul>

<p>   Regarding the nature of mathematical models: mathematics, mathematical models and constructs are created by people. Before the act of creation they do not exist. But the interesting thing is that the models can be isomorphic to the part of the reality.</p>

</h3>

<p>   There is a short list of the postulates of natural selection (there is a more detailed list of the postulates in section <strong>1</strong>):</p>

<ul>
<li>  (<strong>p1</strong>) Individuals and the environment (individuals ARE the environment?)</li>
<li>  (<strong>p2</strong>) Selection</li>
<li>  (<strong>p3</strong>) Reproduction (doubling?)</li>
<li>  (<strong>p4</strong>) Heredity (conservation/invariability?)</li>
<li>  (<strong>p5</strong>) Variation (spontaneous/random?)</li>
</ul>

<p>   The process of natural selection can be viewed as the process of transferring information from the individual to it’s offspring. It is the information about possible interactions of the individual with the environment (and about reactions of the individual to these interactions). Among others this point of view is being promoted by Chris Adami [<a href="#3">3</a>]. Something like BVSR (“blind variation with selective retention” introduced by Donald T. Campbell [<a href="#4">4</a>]) can be mentioned as an example. If a specific structure of the individual promotes that the number of it’s offspring is larger than the number of competing individuals offspring then that specific structure will spread. Individuals that are less “fit” will die, and more “fit” individuals will multiply. So the information about the environment “imprints” into the structure of individuals.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most likely, in the mathematical model to be created the environment will be other individuals, and there would be nothing but individuals. It may even be very primitive “atomic” individuals (whatever that means).</p></li>
<li><p>For natural selection to work, individual and its descendants must meet very similar events and interactions. Otherwise the information will not be imprinted in the structure of the individual (actually any imprinted information will not be useful).</p></li>
<li><p>“Reproduction” (p3) provides an environment of identical individuals. But apart from similar events they meet new and unique ones, which are provided by “variation” (p5). </p></li>
<li><p>If some of the desired properties were not put in the model from the beginning, it is not necessary that they will appear there later. Therefore, it is desirable that postulates of natural selection were in the model from the very beginning (from the first step?). This may even be their primitive counterparts that are surprisingly implicit in the model under construction.</p></li>
<li><p>Most likely, spontaneous/random features are postulated in “variation (p5) about the same way as uncertainty and probabilities of the outcomes is postulated in the probability theory (using classical definition of probability).</p></li>
</ul>

</h3>

<p>   Previously described point of view on the model partly shows mechanisms of it’s evolution and increasing complexity. There is also a point of view on the model as on the structure that changes in time. It is not clear what are the individuals in that structure. It can be assumed that individuals are stable patterns like waves existing in the discrete structure that consists of interconnected parts (like graph). Their origin may even be the topological curvature [<a href="#5">5</a>] (knots? [<a href="#6">6</a>] braids? [<a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#8">8</a>]). The patterns should be resistant to perturbations. The origin of these perturbations is not yet determined. Likely, it should take into account the postulates of the natural selection. The process of changing the structure in time can be similar to the following views:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is only the present. The past no longer exists, the future does not exist yet. There is a description of the structure at each moment of time. The description at the next moment of time depends only on the description at the previous moment of time.</p></li>
<li><p>The growing universe. The structure at the next moment of time may depend on any preceding moment. Furthermore, only part of the entire structure may change at the next moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Here we need to understand whether these views are equivalent (whether there is an isomorphism between them). Perhaps, the second description can always be reduced to the first. It all depends on specific description of the structure, which has not yet been invented.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, if the space-time structure will have similarities with a screw dislocation in a crystal or with a Riemann surface then the selection of “layers” of the present may be a nontrivial task. The possibility that the process of changing of the parts of the structure (space-time description) is a partially ordered set should also be investigated. In a partially ordered set not all elements of the space-time structure are comparable against relation earlier in time/later in time/same time. In contrast to a partially ordered set in a totally ordered set all elements of the space-time structure are comparable against the relation mentioned.</p></li>
</ul>

</h3>

<p>   At the moment I’m trying to find an answer to the following question: <em>how is it that the pattern in the structure is the same as the individual in the natural selection?</em></p>

<p>   In other words <em>it’s necessary to combine two previously outlined views on the process and create a complete and holistic picture. And the pattern and the individual are the same in that picture.</em></p>

<p>This inevitably requires answers to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the “atoms” in this structure? What’s the basis of this picture? (May be the atomic parts in the structure similar to a graph are the atomic individuals. And these atomic individuals easily increase their number. Then how do non-atomic individuals appear?)</p></li>
<li><p>In what places of the structure do random variations occur? What are the rules of it’s applying? This question is important, because random variations provide development and complication of the structure.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the state of minimum complexity from which the process begins?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>   The question is about creation of a mathematical dynamic model that satisfies the described conditions. At this point of research I lack intuitive insights on possible structures of that model. So the possible algorithm is to generate a guess on the structure and then check whether it fits conditions. It’s mostly a mathematical problem.</p>

</h3>

<p>   My problem is not only in the nuances and complexities of the construction of the mathematical model. Three years of work on the problem as a hobby did not give any significant results. There is also a feeling that I could have chosen bad tools for creating the model (e.g. myself). The selected assumptions and criteria for the model may also include contradictions or other problems. So I need advice and support not only of the theoretical kind but also of the practical kind: e.g. tool selection and correction of goals.</p>

<p>   Lately it became clear to me that the goal is not to build the model by myself but to build the model. I desperately need advice on how to make this mathematical model to be created (it does not matter, by me or by someone else). How can I try to think about it? Who can I try to attract to the task? Advice on a reformulation of the problem or on the correctness of the problem is also very welcome.</p>

On atrificial life, open ended evolution and “why these laws of nature?” question <a href="#toc">≡</a>
</h2>

<p>   My main goal briefly and correctly: to create a model of Open Ended Evolution (Then test it on the PC. May be even with hardware random number generator). The good overview of the Open Ended Evolution problem is given by Alastair Channon: <a href="http://www.channon.net/alastair/">channon.net/alastair</a>. This name states for an artificial life that don’t stop it’s evolution on a fixed level of complexity but instead progresses further. The only difference seem to be that the model I’d like to create is planned to be the simplest model. To be the simplest in the philosophical sence. Like Occam’s razor. These restrictions of simplicity make the difficulties that I was describing in this open letter (start from the simplest structure, no predetermined structures exept natural selection postulates, no environment, only individuals).</p>

<p>   And the final goal is to answer the “why these laws of nature?” question. More precisly: why these processes take place but not the other. The history in the model of natural selection is a perfect expanation (if we know the whole history) and answer to any “why?” question. But for the model of open ended evolution to be a candidate for a model of the beginning of the universe it should be the simplest model possible (from the philosophical reasoning).</p>

</h3>

<p>Here is an attempt to describe the restrictions and constraints mentioned in section <strong>3</strong> (and described in more details in the open letter) in a more formal way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The model describes process of discrete changes of the graph-like structure.</p></li>
<li><p>The process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex. There are no edges.</p></li>
<li><p>The predetermined rules are applied to the existing graph to get the next graph.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The predetermined rules should include the rules that resemble the postulates of natural selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>4.1 “Reproduction” (may be: spontaneous events of doubling of the vertices)</li>
<li>4.2 “Heredity” (may be: conservation or invariability of some subsgraph of the graph. Or subset of the set of edges of a particular vertex)</li>
<li>4.3 “Variation” (may be: spontaneous events of changing the vertices’ edges during reproduction. There are more than one such events so there are random choices in most cases)</li>
<li>4.4 “Selection” (I’m not sure but there also may be the events of joining two vertices into one. May be this event is applied only to the two vertices that share in their history the same event of doubling)<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As I see it now the edges of the vertices appear to be the structure of the individuals in the natural selection. But I may be wrong.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The are two ways of imagining this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>6.1 Do not draw the history of rules application. Fisrt step: o, Second step: o―o. Here the rule of reproduction was applied.</li>
<li>6.2 Do draw the history of rules application. First step: o, Second step:</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiwi0fruit/open-letter/master/pics/01_second_step.png"><img src="https://65.media.tumblr.com/d0fdb6e91c5db59c0eb213d895ae3d74/tumblr_inline_o0zewtipjS1qd1fz4_500.png" width="50"></a> In this picture the history of reproduction was taken into account. And directed edges are used to denote events of application of the rules to the praph (or to the subgraph of it).  </p>
</li>
<li><p>During the pocess of rules application (partially randomly) we get the history of graph changes. The process of creating such a history is an infinite process.</p></li>
<li><p>In the history of this process should be patterns in the graph that are isomorphic to each other in some sence. If we are imagining the process like in 6.2 then the isomorphic patterns should be found both in time direction and in graph structure. The simplest analogue to this is the waves propagating in the medium.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover there should be the evolution of such patterns that lead to their complication and incorporation the information about the graph structure or about other patterns. Presumably this evolution is led by competition for “staying alive” of such patterns with each other.</p></li>
<li><p>This evolution should not stop at the fixed level of pattern complexity. So it should be the case of Open Ended Evolution.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Presumably, the model to be built should satisfy the 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 constraints. Other constraints may be altered to fit the 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 constraints.</p>

<p>So it's my guess that formal models that satisfy the constraints mentioned can be constructed. But this attempt to describe the constraints is also a <em><strong>request for convincing arguments in favor that the model satisfying the constraints is impossible.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Some notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Presumably, there are many “layers” on which populations exist. The vertices themself are the atomic individuals that are characterised by their edges. All the vertices are the basic population (basic level). But the goal of the model is to get the individuals at next levels: as patterns in the graph (there may be even cycles of patterns changing to each other, like wave). The interesting individuals are patterns (subgraphs that persist in the changing graph during time). And there expected layers on layers.</p></li>
<li><p>From some point of view my task to create this specific model is an attempt to figure out whether postulates of natural selection are sufficient for evolution with endless complication (given the simplest beginning structure possible) or not sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>The constraint that the process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex may be wrong. The cases where there are two or three (but no more) verteses at the beginning should also be investigated.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the a try to create a mathematical dynamic model that satisfies some of the constraints mentioned. I doubt that it would succeed. But it may show some problems and make the limitations of this approach more clear.</p>

</h4>

<p><strong>The decsription of the first model:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The model describes process of discrete changes of the undirected graph structure.</li>
<li>Each vertex has a boolean label “True” or “False”.</li>
<li>The process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex. There are no edges. The vertex has a “True” label.</li>
<li>The predetermined rules are applied to the existing graph to get the next graph.</li>
<li>The predetermined rules that are applied simultaneously:

<ul>
<li>5.1 “Reproduction”. If “parent” vertex’s label is “True” then it reproduces and the “child” vertex is created. The “child” vertex has a “True” label.</li>
<li>5.2 “Variation” + “Heredity”. There is a ½ probability for each edge of “parent” vertex to be in the edges set of “child” vertex.</li>
<li>5.3 “Heredity”. The edge is always created between the “parent” and “child” vertices.</li>
<li>5.4 “Selection”. Forget about the newly created “child” vertices (temparary remove them from the consideration). For each vertex in the reduced graph: If vertex’s label is “True” then for each edge of this vertex the “True” signal is send with ½ probability to the vertex’s neighbors. Then again for each vertex in the reduced graph: If at least one “True” signal came to the vertex then it’s label would be “True” on ther next time step. Otherwise is’s label would be “False”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s draw some steps of this process. “True” vertices would be white. “False” vertices would be black.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start (numbers distinguish vertices):<br>
[○1]</li>
<li>Only 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 were applied (no edges so no “True” signals):<br>
[●1]――[○2]</li>
<li>There are randomly selected outcomes:

<ul>
<li>3.1 [○1]――[●2]――[○3]</li>
<li>3.2 [●1]――[●2]――[○3]</li>
<li>3.3 [○1]――[●2]――[○3]<br>
    ┕―――――――┚</li>
<li>3.4 [●1]――[●2]――[○3]<br>
    ┕―――――――┚</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are even more randomly selected outcomes on this step. So the computer simulation is required.</li>
</ol>

</h4>

<p>There is another model that is more simple in some sense.</p>

<p><strong>The decsription of the second model:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The model describes process of discrete changes of the undirected graph structure.</li>
<li>Each vertex has a non-negative integer label (<em>l</em>≥0, <em>l</em>∈ℕ).</li>
<li>The process starts from the graph consisting of the only one vertex. It has only one loop edge that connects vertex to itself (and it counts as one edge). The vertex has a “1” label.</li>
<li>The predetermined rules are applied to the existing graph to get the next graph.</li>
<li>The predetermined rules that are applied in two stages:

<ul>
<li>5.1 “Individuals and Environment”. For each vertex in the graph: if vertex’s label is positive integer <em>n</em> then <em>n</em> times do the following: the “1” signal is send to an edge that is randomly selected from the vertex’s edges set (including the edge to itself). If the vertex has <em>m</em> edges then the probability is 1/<em>m</em>. Actually the signal is sent to the vertex’s neighbors. Then again for each vertex in the graph: if <em>n</em> signals came to the vertex then it’s label is set to “<em>n</em>”. It can be “0”.</li>
<li>5.2 “Reproduction”. For each vertex in the graph (“parent” vertices): if “parent” vertex’s label is positive integer then it reproduces and the “child” vertex is created. The “child” vertex has a “1” label. The edge that connects “child” vertex to itself is always created.</li>
<li>5.3 “Variation and Heredity”. For each “child” vertex in the graph: If signal came from “X” vertex to “parent” vertex then the “child” vertex has an edge to the “X” vertex.</li>
<li>5.4 “Selection”. For each vertex in the graph: If vertex’s label is “0” then the vertex is removed from the graph together with all it’s edges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s draw some steps of this process. First number distinguish vertices, ∩ reminds on the self edge, ↕ shows that the signal is sent along the self edge, last number is a label:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>1.</strong> [∩1]</li>
<li>
<strong>2.1</strong> 1[↕1]</li>
<li>
<strong>2.2</strong> 1[∩1]――2[∩1]</li>
<li><p><strong>3.</strong> There are randomly selected outcomes:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3.1</strong> 1[∩1]←→2[∩1]<br>
4[∩1]――1[∩1]――2[∩1]――3[∩1]<br>
[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3.2</strong> 1[∩0]―→2[↕2]<br>
1[∩0]――2[∩2]――3[∩1]<br>
  ┕――――――――┚<br>
2[∩2]――3[∩1]<br>
[∩2]――[∩1]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3.3</strong> 1[↕2]←―2[∩0]<br>
3[∩1]――1[∩2]――2[∩0]<br>
  ┕――――――――┚<br>
1[∩2]――3[∩1]<br>
[∩2]――[∩1]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3.4</strong> 1[↕1]――2[↕1]<br>
3[∩1]――1[∩1]――2[∩1]――4[∩1]<br>
[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩1]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4.</strong> 1[∩2]――2[∩1]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4.1</strong> 1[∩2]――2[∩1]<br>
1[↕1]―→2[↕2]<br>
3[∩1]――1[∩1]――2[∩2]――4[∩1]<br>
         ┕――――――――┚<br>
[∩1]――[∩1]――[∩2]――[∩1]<br>
         ┕―――――――┚</p></li>
<li><p><strong>4.2</strong> 1[∩2]――2[∩1]<br>
1[↕↕2]――2[↕1]<br>
3[∩1]==1[∩2]――2[∩1]――4[∩1]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like the weighted edges are required… There are more randomly selected outcomes on this step. So the computer simulation is required to speed up the research.</p>

Why this task? On “Why is there something rather than nothing?” question <a href="#toc">≡</a>
</h2>

<p>   The two described tasks (1. to get laws of nature from natural selection of structures. 2. to create the minimum mathematical model for open ended evolution) are actually the same task.</p>

<p>   The minimal open ended evolution model (OEE model) that are to be created should be capable of producing at its future steps the invariant behaviour of realy huge number of individuals. And this invariant behaviour may be called the laws of nature. I have doubts that we will ever have enough computational power to run the simulation long enough to get this invariant behaviour. But who knows?</p>

<p>   Actually I have a guess (that is to be checked) that if this minimun OEE model exists then it’s realy a simple one. It should have a simple structure, but it’s not easy to formulate it right. It’s like the postulates of natural selection: they are obvious, but until they were formulated it was really hard to assume them.</p>

<p>   And this model is a request from philosophy. It’s actually a philosophical mathematics that uses physics and natural selection theory for inspiration. It’s a task to create explanation framework that answers any “why questions” in the same way that theory of evolution answers lots of why questions on origin of different life forms. If this explanation framework exist then it should answer the ancient question “Why is there something rather than nothing?”. It is rather strange to use laws of nature to answer this question. It’s like a joke about creationist-evolutionist debate: “The God created all the evidence of the evolution”, says creationist. Then the evolutionist replies: “It’s the same as to assume that the God created the world this morning. And he has created me already unshaven”. So all pre-existing structures need explanation (including laws of nature). My current guess is that the model I started to buid in chapter <strong>4</strong> “The minimum mathematical model for open ended evolution (the more precise description of the mathematical part)” lacks something like the “Law of habit” by Charles Peirce or the “Principle of Precedence” by Lee Smolin.</p>
