# Alternative translation of socionics to english + On incompatibility of Socionics and MBTI

This is an alternative translation of one of the braches of socionics to english. My vision of the ***Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model*** (_JAT personality model_). But sometimes my vision goes beyond JAT personality model.

Only the main terms were translated and described so this article is a stub. The notable differences are described in the summary.

## <a name="1.0"></a>1. Summary [≡](#toc)

1. All cognitive functions are called kinds of thinking. I like HBDI approach [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument).

2. The contradictions between MBTI and socionics are made explicit so the type conversion isn’t possible for introverts.

3. Rational/Irrational names were replaced with Judging/Perceiving as these are more accrurate names: remember Rationalism and it’s attitude to emotional thinking. This also helps make contradictions from 2 more clear.

4. “Material thinking” is used instead of Sensing/Sensory, “Associative thinking” is used instead of Intuition, “Task-oriented thinking” is used instead of Thinking/Logic, “Feelings-oriented thinking” is used instead of Feeling/Ethics.

5. Standard MBTI acronyms for Jung functions (Se, Si, Ne, Ni, Fe, Fi, Te, Ti) and dichotomies (N/S, T/F) are used for MBTI partial compatibility purpose. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to avoid using standard MBTI acronyms for Jung/JAT functions.

6. Standard socionics functions symbols (● ○ ▲ △ ◆ ◇ ■ □) and Victor Gulenko’s 8 latin letters (F, S, I, T, E, R, P, L) were abandoned as inconvenient, unpopular in english community or weird :-)

7. Some differences between types in classical socionics and reference types in JAT personality model are outlined.

8. Some differences between information aspects in classical socionics and Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions are outlined.

9. The short descriptions of JAT cognitive functions that are consistent (I hope) with JAT personality model are given. These descriptions are sometimes different from understanding of cognitive functions in other branches of socionics.

## <a name="2.0"></a>2. JAT cognitive functions [≡](#toc)

Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions roughly speaking are the ways of thinking.

1. Additional **function attitude**:
    - [**Introverted** functions (**I**)] Introverted, passed through oneself, passive, restoring, energy saving functions vs.
    - [**Extraverted** functions (**E**)] Extraverted, directed outwards, active, energy-consuming functions.
2. [**Perceiving** functions (**P**)] Perceiving, instinctive, impulsive functions:
    - [**Associative** thinking (**N**)\*] Abstract, imaginative, assumptive, intuitive thinking (breadth of associations) vs.
    - [**Material** thinking (**S**)\*] Tangible-oriented, detailed, concrete, materially-oriented thinking (orientation to physical reality).
3. [**Judging** functions (**J**)] Judging, stable, impulse controlling functions (decision-making):
    - [**Task-oriented** thinking (**T**)] Logical, analytical, algorithmic, task-oriented thinking (orientation to formal side and facs) vs.
    - [**Feelings-oriented** thinking (**F**)] Moral, empathic, social-oriented, interpersonal emotional thinking (feelings, emotional regulation of society).

\* Same abbreviations as in MBTI are used.

Cognitive functions acronyms (with descriptions of ares of responsibility and competence of JAT cognitive functions):

- **Ne** - _Extraverted associative thinking_. Conjectures, guesses and speculations (e.g. about the essence), ideas, curiosity, novelty seeking.
- **Ni** - _Introverted associative thinking_. Fantasy, fictional reality, imagining processes in time, prognostication, prediction, forecasting
- **Se** - _Extraverted material thinking_. Active actions, confrontation, the accumulation of material resources, aggression, strength.
- **Si** - _Introverted material thinking_. Health, comfort, convenience, safety. Perception of sensations and physical qualities.
- **Te** - _Extraverted task-oriented thinking_. Actions and their algorithms, tools, pattern action-result (formal part of activities organizing).
- **Ti** - _Introverted task-oriented thinking_. Order, laws, structures, classification, analysis and comparison.
- **Fe** - _Extraverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Modifying the mood and the emotional state of people hence manipulating their activities (e.g. by means of inspiration and enthusiasm). Modifying group activity is specifically important.
- **Fi** - _Introverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Moral judgment and evaluation, building relationships, synchronization of attitude towards something in a group of people, morality.

## <a name="3.0"></a>3. Aspects as basis in classical socionics vs. JAT cognitive functions as a basis in JAT personality model [≡](#toc)

Unlike classical socionics, in which the basic concept is the aspect of information, the basic concept in JAT personality model is the reference type. In my vision the reference types are characterized by the properties of their Jung cognitive functions. So the basic concepts are actually the Jung cognitive functions which in turn are characterized by the yet unknown neurophysiological mechanisms in the brain and a person’s life experience.

Thus, the ***information aspect*** is something that JAT ***cognitive function uses*** and ***pays attention to***. And the information metabolism is merely interactions between different cognitive functions of the individual or interactions of any cognitive functions of different persons (but it’s easier to track down interactions of the same cognitive functions when we investigate interactions between people).

## <a name="4.0"></a>4. Types in classical socionics vs. reference types in JAT personality model [≡](#toc)

There are 16 reference types in Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model (JAT personality model) that is one of the branches of socionics. This model is actually more like a trait model (like Big Five) not a type theory. *Victor Talanov himself isn’t affiliated with this article as his publications are in russian language only*. But this article summarises some of his ideas.

***Each particular person does not belong to the one of reference types*** in JAT personality model. But instead the similarity between the person and all 16 reference types is evaluated (using questionnaire). So we move from determining of the person’s type to the measuring Jung cognitive functions using similarity to reference types. This procedure is described in more details in works of Talanov [sociotoday.narod.ru/index1.html](http://sociotoday.narod.ru/index1.html)

This approach is also useful in determining of 1-3 closest reference types without questionnaire (using observations only). In this case the reference types are simply socionics types weighted with degrees of likeness. And even in this case the properties of Jung cognitive functions can be roughly determined using the Model A and weighted averaging of functions properties for all reference types found.

## <a name="5.0"></a>5. Reference types abbreviations [≡](#toc)

There are 4 letter names like *INTJ-Ti-dom* or *ESFP-Se-dom*. For example *INTJ-Ti-dom* is *associative task-oriented judging introvert* with dominant *Ti*. So the first part of the name is given by:

- **NT** is *associative task-oriented*
- **NF** is *associative feelings-oriented*
- **ST** is *material task-oriented*
- **SF** is *material feelings-oriented*

And the last part of the name is given by:

- **EP** is *perceiving extravert*
- **IJ** is *judging introvert*
- **IP** is *perceiving introvert*
- **EJ** is *judging extravert*

## <a name="6.0"></a>6. On dichotomies, MBTI incompatibility, Big Five [≡](#toc)

***Important*** thing to note is that

*   If the reference type’s dominant function is extraverted then the behaviour of the reference type is also more extraverted than introverted (and vice versa).

*   If the reference type’s dominant function is perceiving then the behaviour of the reference type is also more perceiving than judging (and vice versa).

*   If the reference type’s dominant function is one of the associative thinking functions then the behaviour of the reference type is also more associative than tangible-oriented and material (and vice versa).

*   If the reference type’s dominant function is one of the task-oriented thinking functions then the behaviour of the reference type is also more task-oriented than feelings-oriented (and vice versa).

This leads to the possibility of defining I/E, P/J, S/N, F/T dichotomies and obtaining correlations with Big Five personality model [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator#Big_Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Big_Five). In that study the MBTI ***dichotomies*** used are somewhere ___about the same___ as in socionics. But at the same time the hypothesis about the internal structure of type’s ***Jung cognitive functions properties*** are ___different___ in MBTI and socionics (in JAT personality model).

Good infographics on Big Five (that have close relations with socioncs and MBTI) is given here: [psychologycharts.com/big-five-personality-traits.html](http://www.psychologycharts.com/big-five-personality-traits.html). There are also some other good names and connections.

It’s worth mentioning that the socionics hypothesis of correlations between dichotomies and Jung cognitive functions are expected to be statistical or visible only in the most vivid cases of persons. For example: if we see the highly introverted (I) and highly self-disciplined (J) person then what Jung function he would expect he has as his dominant function? Socionics says that it would be Ti or Fi. MBTI says it would be Ni or Si. But in many particular cases of people there can be combinations of “Ti-dominant and more like perceiving behavior” or “Ni-dominant and more like judging behaviour”. But in most cases the socionics expects “Ti-dominant and more like judging behavior”. This even can be experimentally verified by tests that measure Jung cognitive functions and dichotomies independently.

So if we are talking about type of particular person not about reference types then using I/E and J/P dichotomies can be misleading or inaccurate. So the noting person’s dominant function is a better option. For example: Ne-dom, Ti-dom. Auxilary function also worth noting but socionics research shown that for example in case of Ne-dom and task-oriented thinking (T) both Te (8) and Ti (2) may play importaint role in assisting dominant Ne. So they both can be viewed as auxilary function as Jung meant it (actually Jung didn’t say whether auxilary function for Ne-dom is Ti or Te). There need to be more invesigations on this topic but for now it’s more accurate to think that the auxilary function is just T, F, S or N withount specifying whether it is Te ot Ti, etc.

## <a name="7.0"></a>7. Socionics/JAT/MBTI names [≡](#toc)

Names are in the following order:

- **JAT name**, Socionics name, MBTI name, **Number name**.

In *JAT name* the 4 letter code shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part after hyphen shows cognitive functions stack. MBTI does not have counterpart types for introverts. For example the closest counterpart for *INTJ-Ti-dom* is *INTx* that is one of two types *INTJ/INTP* (or their mixture).

## <a name="8.0"></a>8. Quadras and functions [≡](#toc)

Socionics **quadras** split 16 types to 4 groups. Each group has **EP** type with a dominant extraverted perceiving function, **IJ** type with a dominant introverted judging function, **EJ** type with a dominant extraverted judging function and **IP** type with a dominant introverted perceiving function.

We also get **shorter names** like INTJ(α) by using quadra letters.  

Dominant function in socionics is called **1st** function. And socionics splits Jung's auxilary function to **2nd** function and **8th** function. If the 1st function is extraverted then the 2nd is introverted and the 8th is extraverted. And vice versa. In case of INTJ-Ti-dom it would be ¹Ti²Ne⁸Ni (1Ti-2Ne-8Ni). 1st, 2nd and 8th functions are the most important from the point of view of the type’s social activities. And may be also they are the most important from the point of view of the type’s self-identification.

| **Quadra** | **EP** | **IJ** | **IP** | **EJ** |
|:---|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| α&nbsp;alpha | ENTP&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Ne²Ti⁸Te | INTJ(α)&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Ti²Ne⁸Ni | ISFP(α)&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Si²Fe⁸Fi | ESFJ&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Fe²Si⁸Se |
| β&nbsp;betta | ESTP&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Se²Ti⁸Te | ISTJ(β)&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Ti²Se⁸Si | INFP(β)&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Ni²Fe⁸Fi | ENFJ&nbsp;&nbsp;¹Fe²Ni⁸Ne |

|:--:|:--:|
| αδ | Ne or Si |
| βγ | Se or Ni |
| αβ | Fe or Ti |
| γδ | Te or Fi |

## <a name="9.0"></a>9. Intermediate types & shorter notations [≡](#toc)

1. Names for truly **intermediate types** are proposed. Names for unknown types like ExTJ are common (this can be ENTJ, ESTJ or intermediate type, we do not know which one exactly). Similarly EμTJ/EuTJ (like μTorrent/uTorrent) is the name for truly intermediate type. **μ** is the standard symbol that denotes mean value. We also automatically get **explicit notation** like IxTJ-Ti-dom. The existence of intermediate types is still an open question. It's easy to imagine intermediate type between types with the same dominant function but not with different ones.
2. **Shorter notations** with Jung cognitive functions shortcuts can be used. Notations like **TiN** = Ti-dom-N-aux - dominant introverted thinking and auxilary intuition (as Jung meant auxilary function). Actually Jung didn’t say whether auxilary function for Ti-dom is Ne or Ni. So INTJ-Ti-dom can be shortened to **INTJ(TiN)**.
3. Socionics **quadras** can also be used for shorter notations.
4. Below are some some examples of short names for types, unknown types and intermediate/mixed types. The 4 letter code at the beggining shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part shows cognitive functions stack. I guess it may even be possible to have **ENTJ-Ne-dom** if the person is a mixture equally of ENTP, ENTJ and INTJ-Ti-dom: ENTJ(NeT/TiN/TeN). But at the moment it's a speculation only.

Preferable short names:

|  | **EP** | **IJ** | **IP** | **EJ** |
|:---|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| α | ENTP | INTJ(α)&nbsp;&nbsp;INTJ(TiN) | ISFP(α)&nbsp;&nbsp;ISFP(SiF) | ESFJ |
| β | ESTP | ISTJ(β)&nbsp;&nbsp;ISTJ(TiS) | INFP(β)&nbsp;&nbsp;INFP(NiF) | ENFJ |
| γ | ESFP | ISFJ(γ)&nbsp;&nbsp;ISFJ(FiS) | INTP(γ)&nbsp;&nbsp;INTP(NiT) | ENTJ |
| δ | ENFP | INFJ(δ)&nbsp;&nbsp;INFJ(FiN) | ISTP(δ)&nbsp;&nbsp;ISTP(SiT) | ESTJ |

Additional postfixes are needed when there should be noted that socioics types are meant (but not the MBTI types). This is relevant for unknown types with **x** on J/P axis because quadra letters only do not help in this case. For example **INTx(Jα/Pγ)** = INTJ(TiN) or INTP(NiT) or INTu. But if we take MBTI types then **INTx** = INTP(TiN) or INTJ(NiT) or INTu. This is not relevant for intermediate types with **μ** on J/P axis.
