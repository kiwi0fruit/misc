[IxTx list]
================================
This is a special MAL profile https://myanimelist.net/profile/ixtx that contains anime, manga and LN with:

1) romance with IxTx females (â™¡ tag).
2) or when IxTx is one of the main characters.

IxTx personality is like kuuderes or not very emotional danderes. See MBTI for more details or in this text: https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/misc/blob/master/ixtx-female-love-stories/reddit_1.md

ðŸ‘Š tag marks IxTx that are violent/agressive or something like that.

I've read/watched "completed" media. I've dropped or haven't even started "dropped" media. So I can't really comment on it or be sure. Some people said there are romance with kuuderes or IxTx.
