[b]Kuudere, dandere, introverted and logical female love stories[/b]

I'm looking for a specific female characters from anime or other media (movies, manga, comics, TV series, books...) with an enough developed romance story. It should be stories where there is enough hope for successful love-story ending for such characters. There are many media where there is clearly no hope for such characters and they have unrequited love. Or such characters are friends only. Or there are media without romance at all. This is not what I'm looking for.

And these female characters should be:

- Kuuderes
- [b]or[/b] danderes that are logical thinking or not very emotional "inside". That do not loose their head. May be even not good at relationship establishment — do not see other peoples relationships or do not pay attention to it (but this is not always the case).
- [b]or[/b] introverted "emotionless girls"
- [b]or[/b] introverted thinking types (IxTx) from MBTI [i](see the paragraph after this list)[/i]
- [b]that[/b] are non violent and non aggressive. At least she does not force other people to do what she wants (or stop doing something​) violently or aggressively when it's not her duty.

But there are more than that. Three first types of characters actually are some subset of IxTx personality types from MBTI (INTJ, INTP, ISTJ, ISTP). Also with an additional condition of being non violent and non aggressive personality (see above for details) - this is in most cases valid for INTx, but sometimes is not valid for ISTx. Surely there are IxTx that are neither emotionless girls nor kuuderes.

- [b][i]I[/i][/b] means introverted: more quiet than noisy, more passive than active, more observer than participant, more loner than social. Actually it's a complex trait that's not yet well defined.
- [b][i]T[/i][/b] means prefering logical reasoning over feelings.

And togeter (IxTx) it's a smart and reserved personality, sometimes it's a shy personality, sometimes not. Smartness is about analisys and intelligense but not in knowing other people feelings and relationships (or they simply see relationships as something logical). Sometimes such characters simply lack interest or skills in feelings and relationships (it may look like social bluntness) but there is also no information about them being smart or logical (it's out of the narration).

[b][i]So the criteria is actually IxTx.[/i][/b]

[b][Manga] only series that I didn't enjoy[/b]:

Mostly consist of manga that I've dropped early. So I can't really comment on it or be sure. Some people said there are romance with kuuderes or IxTx.

1. [i]Last Game[/i] [manga] - [b]Mikoto Kujou[/b] [She is IxTx.]

[b][Don't fit]: [Anime] series examples that does not fit:[/b]

1. [i]Bakemonogatari[/i] - [b]Hitagi Senjougahara[/b] [Aggressive/violent IxTx (not a fake aggression).]
2. [i]Melancholy / Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya[/i] - [b]Yuki Nagato[/b]. [The anime is great but the love story is doomed from the begining.]
3. [i]Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl[/i] - [b]Erio Touwa[/b], [b]Maekawa[/b] [i](Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko)[/i] [Both Erio and Maekawa seem to be IxTx (not sure about Erio) but the main lead is Ryuuko Mifune. Despite the fact that it doesn't fit I really enjoyed it.]
4. [i]Say "I love you"[/i] - [b]Mei Tachibana[/b] [i](Sukitte Ii na yo)[/i] [Mei seems to be more oriented to feelings than to logical reasoning. And she lacks the charm of straightforwardness that kuuderes often have (straightforwardness slightly higher than shyness is also good).]
5. [i]The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan[/i] - [b]Yuki Nagato[/b] [Same as for Mei Tachibana.]

[i]If you feel like you'd like to add aggressive/violent IxTx female characters to the list then please go ahead.[/i]

3. [i]Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell[/i] (2015) [TV series] - [b]Mr Norrell[/b] [No love story, only good friendship story but it deserves mentioning because this kind of personality is so rare in movies.]
4. [i]Salmon Fishing in the Yemen[/i] (2011) [movie] - [b]Alfred Jones[/b] [Asperger's actually]

If you feel like you'd like to add male characters to the list then please go ahead.
