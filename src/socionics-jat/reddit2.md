# Socionics-MBTI incompatibility, Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions


## 1. MBTI incompatibility

***Explicit notation*** for socionics types are **INTJ-Ti-dom** and **INTP-Ni-dom**. **J**/**P** in socionics mean the same as in MBTI and Big Five (high/low conscientiousness). Same is for E/I, N/S, T/F. And **dom** is a dominant function as Jung meant it. The rule is simple: judging type has a judging dominant function (perceiving type -> perceiving dominant function). Introverted type has an introverted dominant function (extraverted type -> extraverted dominant function). And this notation explicitly reminds about it.


## 2. Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions

But there are some differences between definitions of **cognitive functions** in MBTI and in *Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model* (JAT). Actually my understanding of Talanov's ideas is a outdated. **JAT cognitive functions** roughly speaking are the ways of thinking:

- Additional **function attitude**:
    - [**Introverted** functions (**I**)] Introverted, passed through oneself, passive, restoring, energy saving functions vs.
    - [**Extraverted** functions (**E**)] Extraverted, directed outwards, active, energy-consuming functions.
- [**Perceiving** functions (**P**)] Perceiving, instinctive, impulsive functions:
    - [**Associative** thinking (**N**)] Abstract, imaginative, assumptive, intuitive thinking (breadth of associations) vs.
    - [**Material** thinking (**S**)] Tangible-oriented, detailed, concrete, materially-oriented thinking (orientation to physical reality).
- [**Judging** functions (**J**)] Judging, stable, impulse controlling functions (decision-making):
    - [**Task-oriented** thinking (**T**)] Logical, analytical, algorithmic, task-oriented thinking (orientation to formal side and facs) vs.
    - [**Feelings-oriented** thinking (**F**)] Moral, empathic, social-oriented, interpersonal emotional thinking (feelings, emotional regulation of society).

- **Ne** - _Extraverted associative thinking_. Conjectures, guesses and speculations (e.g. about the essence), ideas, curiosity, novelty seeking.
- **Ni** - _Introverted associative thinking_. Fantasy, fictional reality, imagining processes in time, prognostication, prediction, forecasting
- **Se** - _Extraverted material thinking_. Active actions, confrontation, the accumulation of material resources, aggression, strength.
- **Si** - _Introverted material thinking_. Health, comfort, convenience, safety. Perception of sensations and physical qualities.
- **Te** - _Extraverted task-oriented thinking_. Actions and their algorithms, tools, pattern action-result (formal part of activities organizing).
- **Ti** - _Introverted task-oriented thinking_. Order, laws, structures, classification, analysis and comparison.
- **Fe** - _Extraverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Modifying the mood and the emotional state of people hence manipulating their activities (e.g. by means of inspiration and enthusiasm). Modifying group activity is specifically important.
- **Fi** - _Introverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Moral judgment and evaluation, building relationships, synchronization of attitude towards something in a group of people, morality.


## 3. Socionics / MBTI types names

Names are in the following order:

- **Socionics name**, Socionics name literal translation, MBTI name, **Number name**.

In my translation of socionics types names to english the 4 letter code shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part after hyphen (if needed) shows cognitive functions stack. MBTI does not have counterpart types for introverts. For example the closest counterpart for *INTJ-Ti-dom* is *INTx* that is one of two types *INTJ/INTP* (or their mixture).

## 4. Why quadras grouped this way?

Let's explain this in the example of the delta quadra.

Deltas are: ENFP-Ne-dom, INFJ-Fi-dom, ESTJ-Te-dom, ISTP-Si-dom. So as commonly believed in MBTI xNFP and xSTJ are not delta. As believed in socionics:

* ENFP-Ne-dom has auxiliary Fi, and Si as most inferior function (to the point of not controlling it so it has its own motivation and becomes valuable function),
* INFJ-Fi-dom has auxiliary Ne, and Te as most inferior,
* ESTJ-Te-dom has auxiliary Si, and Fi as most inferior,
* ISTP-Si-dom has auxiliary Te, and Ne as most inferior.

So the functions the type values most are dominant, auxiliary and the most inferior. For some reason commonly ENFP-Ne-dom also values Te, INFJ-Fi-dom also values Si, ESTJ-Te-dom also values Ne, ISTP-Si-dom also values Fi (as believed in socionics).

So this can be seen that these 4 types has the same 4 most valued functions.
