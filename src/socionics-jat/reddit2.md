# Alternative translation of Socionics to English + On incompatibility of Socionics and MBTI

*(Backup of the [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JungianTypology/comments/9jwhk8/socionicsmbti_incompatibility))*

*(This article corrects and continues the [previous one](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/misc/blob/master/src/socionics-jat/intro.md))*

This is an alternative translation of one of the braches of Socionics to English. My vision of the ***Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model*** (_JAT personality model_). But sometimes my vision goes beyond JAT personality model. Only the main terms were translated and described so this article is a stub. The notable differences are described in the summary.

## Summary

1. All cognitive functions are called kinds of thinking. I like HBDI approach [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument).
2. The contradictions between MBTI and Socionics are made explicit so the type conversion isn’t possible for introverts.
3. Rational/Irrational names were replaced with Judging/Perceiving as these are more accrurate names: remember Rationalism and it’s attitude to emotional thinking. This also helps make contradictions from 2 more clear.
4. “Sensory thinking” is used instead of Sensing/Sensorics, “Intuitive thinking” is used instead of Intuition, “Task-oriented thinking” is used instead of Thinking/Logic, “Feelings-oriented thinking” is used instead of Feeling/Ethics.
5. Modified standard MBTI acronyms for Jung functions (Se\*, Si\*, Ne\*, Ni\*, Fe\*, Fi\*, Te\*, Ti\*) and dichotomies (E/I, N/S, T/F, P/J) are used for MBTI partial compatibility purpose. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to avoid using standard MBTI acronyms for Jung/JAT functions.
6. Standard socionics functions symbols (● ○ ▲ △ ◆ ◇ ■ □) and Victor Gulenko’s 8 latin letters (F, S, I, T, E, R, P, L) were abandoned as inconvenient, unpopular in English community or weird :-)
7. Some differences between types in classical Socionics and reference types in Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model are outlined.
8. Some differences between information aspects in classical socionics and Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions are outlined.
9. The short descriptions of JAT cognitive functions that are consistent (I hope) with JAT personality model are given. These descriptions are sometimes different from understanding of cognitive functions in other branches of Socionics.


## 1. Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions

But there are some differences between definitions of **cognitive functions** in MBTI and in *Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model* (JAT). Actually my understanding of Talanov's ideas is a outdated. **JAT cognitive functions** roughly speaking are the ways of thinking:

- Additional **function attitude**:
    - [**Introverted** functions (**I**)] Introverted, passed through oneself, passive, restoring, energy saving functions vs.
    - [**Extraverted** functions (**E**)] Extraverted, directed outwards, active, energy-consuming functions.
- [**Perceiving** functions (**P**)] Perceiving, instinctive, impulsive functions:
    - [**Intuitive** thinking (**N**)] Abstract, imaginative, assumptive, associative thinking / perception (breadth of associations) vs.
    - [**Sensory** thinking (**S**)] Tangible-oriented, detailed, concrete, materially-oriented thinking / perception (orientation to physical reality and physical qualities).
- [**Judging** functions (**J**)] Judging, stable, impulse controlling functions (decision-making):
    - [**Task-oriented** thinking (**T**)] Logical, analytical, algorithmic, task-oriented thinking, reasoning (orientation to formal side and facs) vs.
    - [**Feelings-oriented** thinking (**F**)] Moral, empathic, sentimental, social-oriented, interpersonal emotional thinking (feelings, emotional regulation of society).

- **Ne\*** - _Extraverted intuitive thinking_. Conjectures, guesses and speculations (e.g. about the essence), ideas, curiosity, novelty seeking.
- **Ni\*** - _Introverted intuitive thinking_. Fantasy, fictional reality, imagining processes in time, prognostication, prediction, forecasting
- **Se\*** - _Extraverted sensory thinking_. Active actions, confrontation, the accumulation of material resources, aggression, strength.
- **Si\*** - _Introverted sensory thinking_. Health, comfort, convenience, safety. Perception of sensations.
- **Te\*** - _Extraverted task-oriented thinking_. Actions and their algorithms, tools, pattern action-result (formal part of activities organizing).
- **Ti\*** - _Introverted task-oriented thinking_. Order, laws, structures, classification, analysis and comparison.
- **Fe\*** - _Extraverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Modifying the mood and the emotional state of people hence manipulating their activities (e.g. by means of inspiration and enthusiasm). Modifying group activity is specifically important.
- **Fi\*** - _Introverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Moral judgment and evaluation, building relationships, synchronization of attitude towards something in a group of people, morality.

Mind that extraverted and introverted functions are specializations on top of their "general" basic functions. For example both strong Se\* and Si\* are good at dealing with physical qualities. Both strong Ne\* and Ni\* are good at dealing with associations.

Don't mix Si that is MBTI function with Si\* that is Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive function. Asterisks are added for this purpose. 


## 2. Aspects as basis in classical Socionics vs. JAT cognitive functions as a basis in JAT personality model

Unlike classical Socionics, in which the basic concept is the aspect of information, the basic concept in JAT personality model is the reference type. In my vision the reference types are characterized by the properties of their Jung cognitive functions. So the basic concepts are actually the Jung cognitive functions which in turn are characterized by the yet unknown neurophysiological mechanisms in the brain and a person’s life experience.

Thus, the ***information aspect*** is something that JAT ***cognitive function uses*** and ***pays attention to***. And the information metabolism is merely interactions between different cognitive functions of the individual or interactions of any cognitive functions of different persons (but it’s easier to track down interactions of the same cognitive functions when we investigate interactions between people).


## 3. Types in classical Socionics vs. reference types in JAT personality model

There are 16 reference types in Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model (JAT personality model) that is one of the branches of Socionics. This model is actually more like a trait model (like Big Five) not a type theory. *Victor Talanov himself isn’t affiliated with this article as his publications are in Russian language only*. But this article summarises some of his ideas.

***Each particular person does not belong to the one of reference types*** in JAT personality model. But instead the similarity between the person and all 16 reference types is evaluated (using questionnaire). So we move from determining of the person’s type to the measuring Jung cognitive functions using similarity to reference types. This procedure is described in more details in works of Talanov [sociotoday.narod.ru/index1.html](http://sociotoday.narod.ru/index1.html)

This approach is also useful in determining of 1-3 closest reference types without questionnaire (using observations only). In this case the reference types are simply socionics types weighted with degrees of likeness. And even in this case the properties of Jung cognitive functions can be roughly determined using the Model A and weighted averaging of functions properties for all reference types found.


## 4. Reference types abbreviations

There are 4 letter names like *INTJ-Ti\*-dom* or *ESFP-Se\*-dom*. For example *INTJ-Ti\*-dom* is *intuitive task-oriented judging introvert* with dominant *Ti\**. So the first part of the name is given by:

- **NT** is *intuitive task-oriented*
- **NF** is *intuitive feelings-oriented*
- **ST** is *sensory task-oriented*
- **SF** is *sensory feelings-oriented*

And the last part of the name is given by:

- **EP** is *perceiving extravert*
- **IJ** is *judging introvert*
- **IP** is *perceiving introvert*
- **EJ** is *judging extravert*


## 1. MBTI incompatibility

***Explicit notation*** for socionics types are **INTJ-Ti\*-dom** and **INTP-Ni\*-dom**. **J**/**P** in socionics mean the same as in MBTI and Big Five (high/low conscientiousness). Same is for E/I, N/S, T/F. And **dom** is a dominant function as Jung meant it. The rule is simple: judging type has a judging dominant function (perceiving type -> perceiving dominant function). Introverted type has an introverted dominant function (extraverted type -> extraverted dominant function). And this notation explicitly reminds about it.


## 3. Socionics vs. MBTI types names

Names are in the following order:

- **Socionics name**, Socionics name literal translation, MBTI name, **Number name**.

In my translation of socionics types names to english the 4 letter code shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part after hyphen (if needed) shows cognitive functions stack. MBTI does not have counterpart types for introverts. For example the closest counterpart for *INTJ-Ti\*-dom* is *INTx* that is one of two types *INTJ/INTP* (or their mixture).

Mnemonics to remember the numbers:

|     |               |                                                    |

|  15 | ISTP-Si\*-dom | Brings *almost* everything to the end              |
|  16 | ESTJ-Te\*-dom | Brings everything to the end                       |


## 4. Why quadras grouped this way?

Let's explain this in the example of the delta quadra.

Deltas are: ENFP-Ne\*-dom, INFJ-Fi\*-dom, ESTJ-Te\*-dom, ISTP-Si\*-dom. So as commonly believed in MBTI xNFP and xSTJ are not delta. As believed in socionics:

* ENFP-Ne\*-dom has auxiliary Fi\*, and Si\* as most inferior function (to the point of not controlling it so it has its own motivation and becomes valuable function),
* INFJ-Fi\*-dom has auxiliary Ne\*, and Te\* as most inferior,
* ESTJ-Te\*-dom has auxiliary Si\*, and Fi\* as most inferior,
* ISTP-Si\*-dom has auxiliary Te\*, and Ne\* as most inferior.

So the functions the type values most are dominant, auxiliary and the most inferior. For some reason commonly ENFP-Ne-dom also values Te, INFJ-Fi\*-dom also values Si\*, ESTJ-Te\*-dom also values Ne\*, ISTP-Si\*-dom also values Fi\* (as believed in socionics).

So this can be seen that these 4 types has the same 4 most valued functions.


## 5. Intermediate types names

1. Names for truly **intermediate types** are proposed. Names for unknown types like ExTJ are common (this can be ENTJ, ESTJ or intermediate type, we do not know which one exactly). Similarly EμTJ/EuTJ (like μTorrent/uTorrent) is the name for truly intermediate type. **μ** is the standard symbol that denotes mean value. We also automatically get **explicit notation** like IxTJ-Ti\*-dom. The existence of intermediate types is still an open question. It's easy to imagine intermediate type between types with the same dominant function but not with different ones.
2. Below are some examples of short names for types, unknown types and intermediate/mixed types. The 4 letter code at the beginning shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part shows cognitive functions stack. I guess it may even be possible to have **ENTJ-Ne\*-dom** if the person is a mixture equally of ENTP-Ne\*-dom, ENTJ-Te\*-dom and INTJ-Ti\*-dom: ENTJ(1\~2~12). But at the moment it's a speculation only.
3. Additional postfixes are needed when there should be noted that socioics types and functions are meant (but not the MBTI types and functions). This is especially relevant for unknown types with **x** on J/P axis. For example **INTx<2,11>** = INTJ-Ti\*-dom or INTP-Ni\*-dom or INTu(2~11). But if we take MBTI types then **INTx** = INTP-Ti-dom or INTJ-Ni-dom or INTu.

# 6. Translation of some useful socionics terms. Pacific vs. resolute types

Terms that can describe a person or a type.

1. extraverted vs. introverted, extravert vs. introvert (E vs. I),
2. judging vs. perceiving, judger vs. perceiver (J vs. P),
3. intuitive vs. sensory, intuiter vs. sensor (N vs. S)  
  (Though I'm not fond of using neither sensors nor detectors),
4. task-oriented vs. feelings-oriented, tasker vs. feeler (T vs. F)  
  (Though I'm not fond of using neither feelers nor tentacles. My favourite is "sensing feelers" 🐙),
5. dominant or first function, auxiliary or second function,
6. pacific aka alpha-delta: having Ne\* and Si\* as valuable functions (AD vs. BG)  
  (More fond of cooperative, sensible, peaceful and leisurely unhurried ways),
7. resolute aka beta-gamma: having Se\* and Ni\* as valuable functions (AD vs. BG)  
  (More fond of competitive, argessive, time-bound and fast resolutive ways),
8. alpha-beta: having Fe\* and Ti\* as valuable functions (AB vs. GD),
9. gamma-delta: having Te\* and Fi\* as valuable functions (AB vs. GD),

Examples:

* feelings-oriented sensor, sensory feeler,
* task-oriented intuiter, intuitive tasker,
* alpha-delta intuiter, pacific intuiter, pacific sensor,
* beta-gamma intuiter, resolute intuiter, resolute sensor,
* gamma-delta tasker,
* resolute introvert,
* extraverted perceiving intuitive tasker, first type,
* task-oriented intuitive perceiving extravert,
* introverted judging sensory feeler, tenth type,
* feelings-oriented sensory judging introvert.
