# Socionics-MBTI incompatibility, Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions, Socionics/MBTI types names


## 1. MBTI incompatibility

***Explicit notation*** for socionics types are **INTJ-Ti-dom** and **INTP-Ni-dom**. **J**/**P** in socionics mean the same as in MBTI and Big Five (high/low conscientiousness). Same is for E/I, N/S, T/F. And **dom** is a dominant function as Jung meant it. The rule is simple: judging type has a judging dominant function (perceiving type -> perceiving dominant function). Introverted type has an introverted dominant function (extraverted type -> extraverted dominant function). And this notation explicitly reminds about it.


## 2. Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions

But there are some differences between definitions of **cognitive functions** in MBTI and in *Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov personality model* (JAT). Actually my understanding of Talanov's ideas is a outdated. **JAT cognitive functions** roughly speaking are the ways of thinking:

- Additional **function attitude**:
    - [**Introverted** functions (**I**)] Introverted, passed through oneself, passive, restoring, energy saving functions vs.
    - [**Extraverted** functions (**E**)] Extraverted, directed outwards, active, energy-consuming functions.
- [**Perceiving** functions (**P**)] Perceiving, instinctive, impulsive functions:
    - [**Intuitive** thinking (**N**)] Abstract, imaginative, assumptive, associative thinking (breadth of associations) vs.
    - [**Sensory** thinking (**S**)] Tangible-oriented, detailed, concrete, materially-oriented thinking (orientation to physical reality and physical qualities).
- [**Judging** functions (**J**)] Judging, stable, impulse controlling functions (decision-making):
    - [**Task-oriented** thinking (**T**)] Logical, analytical, algorithmic, task-oriented thinking, reasoning (orientation to formal side and facs) vs.
    - [**Feelings-oriented** thinking (**F**)] Moral, empathic, sentimental, social-oriented, interpersonal emotional thinking (feelings, emotional regulation of society).

- **Ne** - _Extraverted intuitive thinking_. Conjectures, guesses and speculations (e.g. about the essence), ideas, curiosity, novelty seeking.
- **Ni** - _Introverted intuitive thinking_. Fantasy, fictional reality, imagining processes in time, prognostication, prediction, forecasting
- **Se** - _Extraverted sensory thinking_. Active actions, confrontation, the accumulation of material resources, aggression, strength.
- **Si** - _Introverted sensory thinking_. Health, comfort, convenience, safety. Perception of sensations.
- **Te** - _Extraverted task-oriented thinking_. Actions and their algorithms, tools, pattern action-result (formal part of activities organizing).
- **Ti** - _Introverted task-oriented thinking_. Order, laws, structures, classification, analysis and comparison.
- **Fe** - _Extraverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Modifying the mood and the emotional state of people hence manipulating their activities (e.g. by means of inspiration and enthusiasm). Modifying group activity is specifically important.
- **Fi** - _Introverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Moral judgment and evaluation, building relationships, synchronization of attitude towards something in a group of people, morality.

Mind that extraverted and introverted functions are specializations on top of their "general" basic functions. For example both strong Se and Si are good at dealing with physical qualities. Both strong Ne and Ni are good at dealing with associations.


## 3. Socionics / MBTI types names

Names are in the following order:

- **Socionics name**, Socionics name literal translation, MBTI name, **Number name**.

In my translation of socionics types names to english the 4 letter code shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part after hyphen (if needed) shows cognitive functions stack. MBTI does not have counterpart types for introverts. For example the closest counterpart for *INTJ-Ti-dom* is *INTx* that is one of two types *INTJ/INTP* (or their mixture).

| quadra | EP | IJ | IP | EJ |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| α alpha **A** | **ENTP**  ILE  ENTP  **1** | **INTJ-&#8288;Ti-&#8288;dom**  LII  INTx  **2** | **ISFP-&#8288;Si-&#8288;dom**  SEI  ISFx  **3** | **ESFJ**  ESE  ESFJ  **4** |
| β beta **B** | **ESTP**  SLE  ESTP  **5** | **ISTJ-&#8288;Ti-&#8288;dom**  LSI  ISTx  **6** | **INFP-&#8288;Ni-&#8288;dom**  IEI  INFx  **7** | **ENFJ**  EIE  ENFJ  **8** |
| γ gamma **G** | **ESFP**  SEE  ESFP  **9** | **ISFJ-&#8288;Fi-&#8288;dom**  ESI  ISFx  **10** | **INTP-&#8288;Ni-&#8288;dom**  ILI  INTx  **11** | **ENTJ**  LIE  ENTJ  **12** |
| δ delta **D** | **ENFP**  IEE  ENFP  **13** | **INFJ-&#8288;Fi-&#8288;dom**  EII  INFx  **14** | **ISTP-&#8288;Si-&#8288;dom**  SLI  ISTx  **15** | **ESTJ**  LSE  ESTJ  **16** |


## 4. Why quadras grouped this way?

Let's explain this in the example of the delta quadra.

Deltas are: ENFP-Ne-dom, INFJ-Fi-dom, ESTJ-Te-dom, ISTP-Si-dom. So as commonly believed in MBTI xNFP and xSTJ are not delta. As believed in socionics:

* ENFP-Ne-dom has auxiliary Fi, and Si as most inferior function (to the point of not controlling it so it has its own motivation and becomes valuable function),
* INFJ-Fi-dom has auxiliary Ne, and Te as most inferior,
* ESTJ-Te-dom has auxiliary Si, and Fi as most inferior,
* ISTP-Si-dom has auxiliary Te, and Ne as most inferior.

So the functions the type values most are dominant, auxiliary and the most inferior. For some reason commonly ENFP-Ne-dom also values Te, INFJ-Fi-dom also values Si, ESTJ-Te-dom also values Ne, ISTP-Si-dom also values Fi (as believed in socionics).

So this can be seen that these 4 types has the same 4 most valued functions.


## 5. Intermediate types names

1. Names for truly **intermediate types** are proposed. Names for unknown types like ExTJ are common (this can be ENTJ, ESTJ or intermediate type, we do not know which one exactly). Similarly EμTJ/EuTJ (like μTorrent/uTorrent) is the name for truly intermediate type. **μ** is the standard symbol that denotes mean value. We also automatically get **explicit notation** like IxTJ-Ti-dom. The existence of intermediate types is still an open question. It's easy to imagine intermediate type between types with the same dominant function but not with different ones.
2. Below are some examples of short names for types, unknown types and intermediate/mixed types. The 4 letter code at the beginning shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part shows cognitive functions stack. I guess it may even be possible to have **ENTJ-Ne-dom** if the person is a mixture equally of ENTP, ENTJ and INTJ-Ti-dom: ENTJ(1\~2~12). But at the moment it's a speculation only.
3. Additional postfixes are needed when there should be noted that socioics types are meant (but not the MBTI types). This is relevant for unknown types with **x** on J/P axis because quadra letters only do not help in this case. For example **INTx<2,11>** = INTJ-Ti-dom or INTP-Ni-dom or INTu. But if we take MBTI types then **INTx** = INTP-Ti-dom or INTJ-Ni-dom or INTu. This is not relevant for intermediate types with **u** on J/P axis.

# 6. Translation of some useful socionics terms

Terms that can describe a person or a type.

1. extraverted vs. introverted, extravert vs. introvert (E vs. I),
2. judging vs. perceiving, judger vs. perceiver (J vs. P),
3. intuitive vs. sensory, intuiter vs. sensor (N vs. S)  
  (Though I don't fond of using neither sensors nor detectors),
4. task-oriented vs. feelings-oriented, tasker vs. feeler (T vs. F)  
  (Though I don't fond of using neither feelers nor tentacles. My favourite is "sensing feelers" 🐙),
5. dominant or first function, auxiliary or second function,
6. serene aka alpha-delta: having Ne and Si as valuable functions (AD vs. BG)  
  (More fond of cooperative, sensible, peaceful and leisurely unhurried ways),
7. resolute aka beta-gamma: having Se and Ni as valuable functions (AD vs. BG)  
  (More fond of competitive, argessive, time-bound and fast resolutive ways),
8. alpha-beta: having Fe and Ti as valuable functions (AB vs. GD),
9. gamma-delta: having Te and Fi as valuable functions (AB vs. GD),

Examples:

* feelings-oriented sensor, sensory feeler,
* task-oriented intuiter, intuitive tasker,
* alpha-delta intuiter, serene intuiter, serene sensor, 
* beta-gamma intuiter, resolute intuiter, resolute sensor,
* gamma-delta tasker,
* resolute introvert,
* extraverted perceiving intuitive tasker, first type,
* task-oriented intuitive perceiving extravert,
* introverted judging sensory feeler, tenth type,
* feelings-oriented sensory judging introvert.
