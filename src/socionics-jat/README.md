# Alternative translation of Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov Socionics to English + On incompatibility of Socionics and MBTI

This is an alternative translation of one of the braches of Socionics to English. My vision of some parts of the ***Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov Socionics*** (*JATS*). But sometimes my vision goes beyond JATS. Only the main terms were translated and described so this article is a stub. The notable differences are described in the summary.

## Summary

1. The short **descriptions of JAT cognitive functions** that are consistent (I hope) with JATS are given. These descriptions are sometimes different from understanding of cognitive functions in other branches of Socionics.
2. All cognitive functions are called **kinds of thinking**. I like HBDI approach [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrmann_Brain_Dominance_Instrument).
3. Concise names for **intermediate and unknown types** were proposed. The names extend MBTI types names. **1-16 numbers as names** for reference types were proposed for mixed types notation and speech (+ mnemonics).
4. The **contradictions between MBTI and Socionics** are made explicit so the type conversion isn’t possible for introverts.
5. Rational/Irrational names were replaced with Judging/Perceiving as these are more accrurate names: remember Rationalism and it’s attitude to emotional thinking. This also helps make contradictions from 4 more clear.
6. “Sensory thinking” is used instead of Sensing/Sensorics, “Intuitive thinking” is used instead of Intuition, “Task-oriented thinking” is used instead of Thinking/Logic, “Feelings-oriented thinking” is used instead of Feeling/Ethics.
7. Modified standard MBTI acronyms for Jung functions (Se', Si', Ne', Ni', Fe', Fi', Te', Ti') and dichotomies (E/I, N/S, T/F, P/J) are used for MBTI partial compatibility purpose. Unfortunately there seems to be no way to avoid using standard MBTI acronyms for Jung/JAT functions.
8. Standard socionics functions symbols (● ○ ▲ △ ◆ ◇ ■ □) and Victor Gulenko’s 8 latin letters (F, S, I, T, E, R, P, L) were abandoned as inconvenient, unpopular in English community or weird :-)
9. Some differences between **types** in classical Socionics and **reference types** in Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov Socionics are outlined.
10. Some differences between **information aspects** in classical socionics and Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov **cognitive functions** are outlined.
11. Very basic introduction to quadras is given and discussed **why quadras grouped this way**.
12. Single-noun terms like intuiter, sensor, feeler and tasker are used. Alpha-delta vs. beta-gamma types is translated as **pacific** vs. **resolute** types.
13. Revised Gulenko's names for types were proposed.


## 1. Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive functions

But there are some differences between definitions of **cognitive functions** in MBTI and in *Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov Socionics* (JATS). Actually my understanding of Talanov's ideas is a outdated. **JAT cognitive functions** roughly speaking are the ways of thinking:

- Additional **function attitude**:
    - [**Introverted** functions (**I**)] Introverted, passed through oneself, passive, restoring, energy saving functions vs.
    - [**Extraverted** functions (**E**)] Extraverted, directed outwards, active, energy-consuming functions.
- [**Perceiving** functions (**P**)] Perceiving, instinctive, impulsive functions:
    - [**Intuitive** thinking (**N**, i**N**tuitive)] Abstract, imaginative, assumptive, associative thinking / perception (breadth of associations) vs.
    - [**Sensory** thinking (**S**)] Tangible-oriented, detailed, concrete, materially-oriented thinking / perception (orientation to physical reality and physical qualities).
- [**Judging** functions (**J**)] Judging, stable, impulse controlling functions (decision-making):
    - [**Task-oriented** thinking (**T**)] Logical, analytical, algorithmic, task-oriented thinking, reasoning (orientation to formal side and facs) vs.
    - [**Feelings-oriented** thinking (**F**)] Moral, empathic, sentimental, social-oriented, interpersonal emotional thinking (feelings, emotional regulation of society).

- **Ne'** - _Extraverted intuitive thinking_. Conjectures, guesses and speculations (e.g. about the essence), ideas, curiosity, novelty seeking.
- **Ni'** - _Introverted intuitive thinking_. Fantasy, fictional reality, imagining processes in time, prognostication, prediction, forecasting
- **Se'** - _Extraverted sensory thinking_. Active actions, confrontation, the accumulation of material resources, aggression, strength.
- **Si'** - _Introverted sensory thinking_. Health, comfort, convenience, safety. Perception of sensations.
- **Te'** - _Extraverted task-oriented thinking_. Actions and their algorithms, tools, pattern action-result (formal part of activities organizing).
- **Ti'** - _Introverted task-oriented thinking_. Order, laws, structures, classification, analysis and comparison.
- **Fe'** - _Extraverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Modifying the mood and the emotional state of people hence manipulating their activities (e.g. by means of inspiration and enthusiasm). Modifying group activity is specifically important.
- **Fi'** - _Introverted feelings-oriented thinking_. Moral judgment and evaluation, building relationships, synchronization of attitude towards something in a group of people, morality.

Mind that extraverted and introverted functions are specializations on top of their "general" basic functions. For example both strong Se' and Si' are good at dealing with physical qualities. Both strong Ne' and Ni' are good at dealing with associations.

Don't mix Si that is MBTI function with Si' that is Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov cognitive function. Apostrophes are added for this purpose.


## 2. Aspects as basis in classical Socionics vs. JAT cognitive functions as a basis in JATS

Unlike classical Socionics, in which the basic concept is the aspect of information, the basic concept in JATS is the reference type. In my vision the reference types are characterized by the properties of their Jung cognitive functions. So the basic concepts are actually the Jung cognitive functions which in turn are characterized by the yet unknown neurophysiological mechanisms in the brain and a person’s life experience.

Thus, the ***information aspect*** is something that JAT ***cognitive function uses*** and ***pays attention to***. And the information metabolism is merely interactions between different cognitive functions of the individual or interactions of any cognitive functions of different persons (but it’s easier to track down interactions of the same cognitive functions when we investigate interactions between people).


## 3. Types in classical Socionics vs. reference types in JATS

There are 16 reference types in Jung-Augustinavichiute-Talanov Socionics (JATS) that is one of the branches of Socionics. JATS is actually more like a trait model (like Big Five) not a type theory. *Victor Talanov himself isn’t affiliated with this article as his publications are in Russian language only*. But this article summarises some of his ideas.

***Each particular person does not belong to the one of reference types*** in JATS. But instead the similarity between the person and all 16 reference types is evaluated (using questionnaire). So we move from determining of the person’s type to the measuring Jung cognitive functions using similarity to reference types. This procedure is described in more details in works of Talanov [sociotoday.narod.ru/index1.html](http://sociotoday.narod.ru/index1.html)

This approach is also useful in determining of 1-3 closest reference types without questionnaire (using observations only). In this case the reference types are simply socionics types weighted with degrees of likeness. And even in this case the properties of Jung cognitive functions can be roughly determined using the Model A and weighted averaging of functions properties for all reference types found.


## 4. Socionics reference types names vs. MBTI types names

Names are in the following order:

- **Socionics reference type long name**, Socionics name literal translation, MBTI name, **Number name**, **Reference type short name**.

In my translation of socionics types names to english the 4 letter code shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part after hyphen (if needed) shows cognitive functions stack. MBTI does not have counterpart types for introverts. For example the closest counterpart for INTJ-Ti'-dom is INTx that is one of two types INTJ/INTP (or their mixture).

| quadra | PE       | JI          | PI          | JE       |
|:-------|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| alpha  | **ENTP⁠-⁠Ne⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  ILE  ENTP  **1**  | **INTJ⁠-⁠Ti⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  LII  INTx  **2**  | **ISFP⁠-⁠Si⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  SEI  ISFx  **3**  | **ESFJ⁠-⁠Fe⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  ESE  ESFJ  **4**  |
|        | **Ne'T** | **Ti'N-JI** | **Si'F-PI** | **Fe'S** |
| beta   | **ESTP⁠-⁠Se⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  SLE  ESTP  **5**  | **ISTJ⁠-⁠Ti⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  LSI  ISTx  **6**  | **INFP⁠-⁠Ni⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  IEI  INFx  **7**  | **ENFJ⁠-⁠Fe⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  EIE  ENFJ  **8**  |
|        | **Se'T** | **Ti'S-JI** | **Ni'F-PI** | **Fe'N** |
| gamma  | **ESFP⁠-⁠Se⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  SEE  ESFP  **9**  | **ISFJ⁠-⁠Fi⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  ESI  ISFx  **10** | **INTP⁠-⁠Ni⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  ILI  INTx  **11** | **ENTJ⁠-⁠Te⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  LIE  ENTJ  **12** |
|        | **Se'F** | **Fi'S-JI** | **Ni'T-PI** | **Te'N** |
| delta  | **ENFP⁠-⁠Ne⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  IEE  ENFP  **13** | **INFJ⁠-⁠Fi⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  EII  INFx  **14** | **ISTP⁠-⁠Si⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  SLI  ISTx  **15** | **ESTJ⁠-⁠Te⁠'⁠-⁠dom**  LSE  ESTJ  **16** |
|        | **Ne'F** | **Fi'N-JI** | **Si'T-PI** | **Te'S** |

For example INTJ-Ti'-dom / Ti'N-JI is *intuitive task-oriented judging introvert* with dominant Ti' (or *introverted judging intuitive tasker*). So the first part of the name is given by:

- **NT** is intuitive task-oriented (or intuiter and tasker),
- **NF** is intuitive feelings-oriented (or intuiter and feeler),
- **ST** is sensory task-oriented (or sensor and tasker),
- **SF** is sensory feelings-oriented (or sensor and feeler).

And the last part of the name is given by:

- **PE** is perceiving extravert (or extraverted perceiver),
- **JI** is judging introvert (or introverted judger),
- **PE** is perceiving introvert (or introverted perceiver),
- **JE** is judging extravert (or extraverted judger).

Though I'm not fond of using neither feelers nor tentacles. Neither sensors nor detectors. My favourite is "sensing feelers" 🐙.

Or if you want to use names that more explicitly differ from MBTI see this table:

| quadra |    PE    |     JI      |     PI      |    JE    |
|:------ |:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| alpha  | **Ne'T** | **Ti'N-JI** | **Si'F-PI** | **Fe'S** |
|        | dominant extraverted intuiter & perceiving tasker | dominant introverted tasker & judging intuiter | dominant introverted sensor & perceiving feeler   | dominant extraverted feeler & judging sensor   |
| beta   | **Se'T** | **Ti'S-JI** | **Ni'F-PI** | **Fe'N** |
|        | dominant extraverted sensor & perceiving tasker   | dominant introverted tasker & judging sensor   | dominant introverted intuiter & perceiving feeler | dominant extraverted feeler & judging intuiter |
| gamma  | **Se'F** | **Fi'S-JI** | **Ni'T-PI** | **Te'N** |
|        | dominant extraverted sensor & perceiving feeler   | dominant introverted feeler & judging sensor   | dominant introverted intuiter & perceiving tasker | dominant extraverted tasker & judging intuiter |
| delta  | **Ne'F** | **Fi'N-JI** | **Si'T-PI** | **Te'S** |
|        | dominant extraverted intuiter & perceiving feeler | dominant introverted feeler & judging intuiter | dominant introverted sensor & perceiving tasker   | dominant extraverted tasker & judging sensor   |

## 6. On dichotomies, MBTI incompatibility, Big Five

***Important*** thing to note is that

*   If the reference type’s dominant function is extraverted then the behaviour of the reference type is also more extraverted than introverted (and vice versa).
*   If the reference type’s dominant function is perceiving then the behaviour of the reference type is also more perceiving than judging (and vice versa).
*   If the reference type’s dominant function is one of the intuitive thinking functions then the behaviour of the reference type is also more intuitive than tangible-oriented and sensory (and vice versa).
*   If the reference type’s dominant function is one of the task-oriented thinking functions then the behaviour of the reference type is also more task-oriented than feelings-oriented (and vice versa).

This leads to the possibility of defining I/E, P/J, S/N, F/T dichotomies and obtaining correlations with Big Five personality model [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator#Big_Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator#Big_Five). In that study the MBTI ***dichotomies*** used are somewhere ___about the same___ as in Socionics. But at the same time the hypothesis about the internal structure of type’s ***Jung cognitive functions properties*** are ___different___ in MBTI and Socionics / JATS.

Good infographics on Big Five (that have close relations with socioncs and MBTI) is given here: [psychologycharts.com/big-five-personality-traits.html](http://www.psychologycharts.com/big-five-personality-traits.html). There are also some other good names and connections.

It’s worth mentioning that the Socionics hypothesis of correlations between dichotomies and Jung cognitive functions are expected to be statistical or visible only in the most vivid cases of persons. For example: if we see the highly introverted (I) and highly self-disciplined (J) person then what Jung congnitive function he would expect they has as dominant function? Socionics says that it would be Ti' or Fi'. MBTI says it would be Ni or Si. But in many particular cases of people there can be combinations of “Ti'-dominant and more like perceiving behavior” or “Ni'-dominant and more like judging behaviour”. But in most cases Socionics expects “Ti'-dominant and more like judging behavior”. This even can be experimentally verified by tests that measure Jung cognitive functions and dichotomies independently.

So if we are talking about type of particular person not about reference types then using I/E and J/P dichotomies can be misleading or inaccurate. So the noting person’s dominant function is a better option. For example: Ne'-dom, Ti'-dom. Auxilary function also worth noting but Socionics research shown that for example in case of Ne'-dom and task-oriented thinking (T) both Te' (8) and Ti' (2) may play importaint role in assisting dominant Ne'. So they both can be viewed as auxilary function as Jung meant it (actually Jung didn’t say whether auxilary function for Ne'-dom is Ti' or Te'). There need to be more invesigations on this topic but for now it’s more accurate to think that the auxilary function is just T, F, S or N withount specifying whether it is Te' ot Ti', etc.

***Explicit notation*** for Socionics types are **INTJ-Ti'-dom** and **INTP-Ni'-dom**. **J**/**P** in socionics mean the same as in MBTI and Big Five (high/low conscientiousness). Same is for E/I, N/S, T/F. And **dom** is a dominant function as Jung meant it. The rule is simple: judging type has a judging dominant function (perceiving type -> perceiving dominant function). Introverted type has an introverted dominant function (extraverted type -> extraverted dominant function). And this notation explicitly reminds about it.


## 7. Quadras and functions. Why quadras grouped this way? Pacific vs. resolute types

Socionics **quadras** split 16 types to 4 groups. Each group has **PE** type with a dominant extraverted perceiving function, **JI** type with a dominant introverted judging function, **JE** type with a dominant extraverted judging function and **PI** type with a dominant introverted perceiving function.

Dominant function in socionics is called **1st** function. And socionics splits Jung's auxilary function to **2nd** function and **8th** function. If the 1st function is extraverted then the 2nd is introverted and the 8th is extraverted. And vice versa. In case of INTJ-Ti'-dom it would be  1Ti'2Ne'8Ni'. 1st, 2nd and 8th functions are the most important from the point of view of the type’s social activities. And may be also they are the most important from the point of view of the type’s self-identification.

| **Quadra**    | **PE** | **JI** | **PI** | **JE** |
|:--------------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| α alpha **A** | ENTP(Ne'T) ENTP(1Ne'2Ti'8Te') | INTJ(Ti'N) INTJ(1Ti'2Ne'8Ni') | ISFP(Si'F) ISFP(1Si'2Fe'8Fi') | ESFJ(Fe'S) ESFJ(1Fe'2Si'8Se') |
| | **Ne'T** | **Ti'N-JI** | **Si'F-PI** | **Fe'S** |
| β beta **B**  | ESTP(Se'T) ESTP(1Se'2Ti'8Te') | ISTJ(Ti'S) ISTJ(1Ti'2Se'8Si') | INFP(Ni'F) INFP(1Ni'2Fe'8Fi') | ENFJ(Fe'N) ENFJ(1Fe'2Ni'8Ne') |
| | **Se'T** | **Ti'S-JI** | **Ni'F-PI** | **Fe'N** |
| γ gamma **G** | ESFP(Se'F) ESFP(1Se'2Fi'8Fe') | ISFJ(Fi'S) ISFJ(1Fi'2Se'8Si') | INTP(Ni'T) INTP(1Ni'2Te'8Ti') | ENTJ(Te'N) ENTJ(1Te'2Ni'8Ne') |
| | **Se'F** | **Fi'S-JI** | **Ni'T-PI** | **Te'N** |
| δ delta **D** | ENFP(Ne'F) ENFP(1Ne'2Fi'8Fe') | INFJ(Fi'N) INFJ(1Fi'2Ne'8Ni') | ISTP(Si'T) ISTP(1Si'2Te'8Ti') | ESTJ(Te'S) ESTJ(1Te'2Si'8Se') |
| | **Ne'F** | **Fi'N-JI** | **Si'T-PI** | **Te'S** |

One of the shortest notations is given as the last name. It's possible to drop postfix for introverts too but then it can easily be mistaken with wrong MBTI type. So it's recommend to be used only in explicit contexts.

|            Quadras | 1st or 2nd function | Valuable functions | Adj.     | More fond of: |
| ------------------:| ------------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| alpha-delta **AD** | Ne' or Si'          | Ne' and Si'        | pacific  | cooperative, sensible, peaceful and leisurely unhurried ways |
|  beta-gamma **BG** | Se' or Ni'          | Se' and Ni'        | resolute | competitive, argessive, time-bound and fast resolutive ways |
|  alpha-beta **AB** | Fe' or Ti'          | Fe' and Ti'        |          |               |
| gamma-delta **GD** | Te' or Fi'          | Te' and Fi'        |          |               |

Examples:

* alpha-delta intuiter, pacific intuiter, pacific sensor,
* beta-gamma intuiter, resolute intuiter, resolute sensor,
* gamma-delta tasker,
* resolute introvert.


#### Why quadras grouped this way?

Let's explain this in the example of the delta quadra.

Deltas are: ENFP-Ne'-dom, INFJ-Fi'-dom, ESTJ-Te'-dom, ISTP-Si'-dom. So as commonly believed in MBTI xNFP and xSTJ are not delta. As believed in socionics:

* ENFP-Ne'-dom has auxiliary Fi', and Si' as most inferior function (to the point of not controlling it so it has its own motivation and becomes valuable function),
* INFJ-Fi'-dom has auxiliary Ne', and Te' as most inferior,
* ESTJ-Te'-dom has auxiliary Si', and Fi' as most inferior,
* ISTP-Si'-dom has auxiliary Te', and Ne' as most inferior.

So the functions the type values most are dominant, auxiliary and the most inferior. For some reason commonly ENFP-Ne-dom also values Te, INFJ-Fi'-dom also values Si', ESTJ-Te'-dom also values Ne', ISTP-Si'-dom also values Fi' (as believed in socionics).

So this can be seen that these 4 types has the same 4 most valued functions.


## 8. Intermediate and unknown types names

1. Names for truly **intermediate types** are proposed. Names for unknown types like ExTJ are common (this can be ENTJ, ESTJ or intermediate type, we do not know which one exactly). Similarly EμTJ/EuTJ (like μTorrent/uTorrent) is the name for truly intermediate type. **μ** is the standard symbol that denotes mean value (capital is M - Mu). We also automatically get **explicit notation** like IxTJ-Ti'-dom. The existence of intermediate types is still an open question. It's easy to imagine intermediate type between types with the same dominant function but not with different ones.
2. Below are some examples of short names for types, unknown types and intermediate/mixed types. The 4 letter code at the beginning shows the position on 4 axes that can be measured by MBTI or Big Five tests (it's OK for J/P and conscientiousness). And the second part shows cognitive functions stack. I guess it may even be possible to have **ENTJ-Ne'-dom** if the person is a mixture equally of ENTP-Ne'-dom, ENTJ-Te'-dom and INTJ-Ti'-dom: ENTJ(1\~2~12). But at the moment it's a speculation only.
3. Additional postfixes are needed when there should be noted that socioics types and functions are meant (but not the MBTI types and functions). This is especially relevant for unknown types with **x** on J/P axis. For example **INTx<2,11>** = INTJ-Ti'-dom or INTP-Ni'-dom or INTu(2~11). But if we take MBTI types then **INTx** = INTP-Ti-dom or INTJ-Ni-dom or INTu.

| **Unknown types**          | **Meaning of unknown types**                    | **Mixed type** |
