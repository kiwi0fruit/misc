# The Wandering Inn

As far as I know there is nothing similar to The Wandering Inn. So there is the list more suitable for those who googled and appeared here (but not for he topic starter). And the similarity is in: fantasy (or even LitRPG), characters are well done, not boring and engaging pacing, neither dark nor depressing and such, overall enjoiment is at the comparable level.

* [Stardust](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16793.Stardust) (and a [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486655/))
* [The Graveyard Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2213661.The_Graveyard_Book)
* [Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell) (and a [tv mini series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2548418/))
* [Konosuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!](https://myanimelist.net/manga/60553/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo) (and an [anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo))

* [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/manga/46024/Log_Horizon) (and an [anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon)). I've only watched the anime so I'm not sure if the novel is good.
* [The Seven Deadly Sins](https://myanimelist.net/manga/44485/Nanatsu_no_Taizai) - it's a manga though (and an [anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23755/Nanatsu_no_Taizai))
* Lots of books by [Diana Wynne Jones](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4260.Diana_Wynne_Jones). It's pretty different from The Wandering Inn but the kind and heartwarming side is close.
* [Mother of Learning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41081167-mother-of-learning)
* [Daybreak on Hyperion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28946950-daybreak-on-hyperion). The first volume was good.
* *obvious and famous*: [The Name of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind), anything by [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/38550.Brandon_Sanderson) (except Alcatraz series).

The order of books doesn't mean anything.
