# The Wind Rises

(2013, Hayao Miyazaki)

**SPOILERS BELOW**

Brilliant theme of following the dream and then seeing it being corrupted by war. Together with seeing that you had not payed enough attention to your love (to beloved wife and to beloved homeland) until it was too late: wife died and Japan was bombed out.
