Kuudere, dandere, introverted and logical female love stories
================================

[*T*I* list]
================================
This is a special MAL profile https://myanimelist.net/profile/ixtx that contains anime, manga and LN with:

1) romance with *T*I* females (â™¡ tag).
2) or when *T*I* is one of the main characters.

*T*I* personality is like kuuderes or not very emotional danderes. It comes from Jungian Typology. See *T*I* in JATS, IxTx in MBTI, LXI/XLI in Socionics for more details. It's recommended to start with this text: https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/misc/blob/master/src/ixtx-female-love-stories/reddit_1.md

ðŸ‘Š tag marks *T*I* that are violent/agressive or something like that.

I've read/watched "completed" media. I've dropped or haven't even started "dropped" media. So I can't really comment on it or be sure. Some people said there are romance with kuuderes or *T*I*.
